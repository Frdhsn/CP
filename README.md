# Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! This repository serves as a central hub where I document, track, and share all my competitive programming activities. Here, you'll find solutions, strategies, and insights that I've gathered through various programming contests and problem-solving sessions.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **`/solutions`**: Contains my solutions to individual problems from various competitive programming platforms.
- **`/contests`**: Code and notes from specific contests I've participated in.
- **`/notes`**: Theoretical notes, algorithm strategies, and data structures used in competitive programming.

## Problem Sources

The problems solved in this repository come from a variety of online judges and contest platforms, including:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

## How to Use This Repository

- **Browse Solutions**: Navigate to the `/solutions` directory to view solutions categorized by the platform or problem complexity.
- **Learn Techniques**: Visit the `/notes` section to read about different algorithms and competitive strategies.
- **Explore Contest Solutions**: Check the `/contests` directory for my contest histories and solutions.

## Contributing
